# WORK EXPLANATION

## For all my code I understand 90,99% of it. 
-
WEEK 1 
I did it by myself in class, and I even ask the teacher about my work whether it is correct or not. I remember I had fun trying to make this. I also remember that I run the deno many times and my webpage is full of tabs.

WEEK 2 
I 100% percent did it by myself in class. The work was just an add-on from the last weeks course so I believe that it was easy to do.

WEEK 3 
The first code I just change the names. The code that teacher taught us is about a blog post, so i just change it into contact numbers. with this contact numbers I just change the words like from title of the blog post to name of the contact numbers and from body of the blog post to the phone number of the user etc for all pages. and then teacher wrote that we have to do find the name and whose number it belongs to. So i add .post(/find-number) to the router and then make a find number function. With this find function I am going to be honest I ask chatgpt on how to do it and I understand all of it. And then I write if theres a contactnumber then show it, if not then go to function notFound. Function not found is a function i made in render. so if the names are not found then it will gives out this notfound page.

WEEK 4 -
I did this 100% by my own. The index.html, login.html, and signup.html that I did is the same like the index.html, add.html and find.html from the things that teacher taught. I realize that the working of how to login is kinda the similiar to how to find the phone number. if you find something and found it then it is a success! its the same like if you login and find the account number and password correct then it is a success! signup was also the same like add, so i just change a little bit here and there. I also add css for the style, and change the index into login and signup. The .js was basically the same except for changing the names and little changes here and there.
