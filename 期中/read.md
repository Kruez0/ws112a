# Explanation
This project was done entirely by me. The first login and sign in is from week 4 homework that i improved and add. The blog is from week 3 and I just mesh it all to make this! When I have questions, I ask chatgpt to fastly know the answer. But, 90% this code was done by me and from the homework that i did.Thankyou!
