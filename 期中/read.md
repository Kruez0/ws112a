# Explanation
This project was done entirely by me. 
The first login and sign in is from week 4 homework that i improved and add, the css design was made by me. At first I use ppt to think about the design. 
![ppt](https://github.com/ccc112a/ws112a/assets/105598068/6e732c44-2579-4346-87ee-d319fffe7df7)
and then I create it. I also asked chatgpt on how to do some of the css functions. because i forgot how to do it.
The blog is from week 3 and I just mesh it all to make this! 
When I have questions, I ask chatgpt to fastly know the answer.90% of this code was done by me because all that I did was improve and add things from the previous homework.There are times when I am confused, like when I want to put together the blog and the login signup. so i tried to make the blog and login signup seperately first. and then i just copy the code from the blog to the loginsignup. after that i change it if login success, then go redirect to await render list. This was done entirely be me! I asked chatgpt about this, and chatgpt just makes me more confused. So, I try to change it by myself and it works! i was very happy.
another thing i asked chat gpt is how to add event listener. I forgot how to do it XD. i want to pop up things for when the password is wrong or password is not enough, no number and chatgpt help me know how to. That's it. The rest was done entirely done by me. Thankyou!
