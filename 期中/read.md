# Explanation
This project was done entirely by me. The first login and sign in is from week 4 homework that i improved and add. The blog is from week 3 and I just mesh it all to make this! When I have questions, I ask chatgpt to fastly know the answer.90% of this code was done by me and from the homework that i did.There are times when I am confused, like when I want to put together the blog and the login signup. so i tried to make the blog and login signup seperately first. and then i just copy the code from the blog to the loginsignup. after that i change it if login success, then go redirect to await render list. and then it will open the blog! the thing i ask chat gpt is how to add event listener. i want to pop up things for when the password is wrong or password is not enough, no number. That's it. 90% was done entirely by me. Thankyou
